# Contributing to this project

## Hello!

Thanks for considering contributing to my project!

Here, I will explain how you can help contribute to this project, what I look 
for, and how to report bugs or suggest improvements.

---

## Contributions You Can Make

There are many ways you can contribute: submitting suggestions or bug 
reports, improving documentation, or writing some code yourself!

I'm primarily looking for any ideas on how to make this project more useful. 
Any addition to the project will be very much appreciated.

### Steps

1. Create a fork of 
   [the repository](https://github.com/TheGittyPerson/day-quality-tracker)
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch with a meaningful name
   - e.g.) `add-feature-xyz`, `fix-issue-12`
4. Make and commit your changes
5. Push commits to GitHub (if you have made changes locally on your machine)
6. Create a pull request and await review

We will likely need to discuss the changes you make and apply some tweaks 
and polishing before approval.

You should receive a notification/email once your changes have been merged 
onto the main branch of this project.

### Making Your First Contribution

If you're new here or are not familiar with contributing to repositories on 
GitHub, 
[here's a repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) 
with information that might help.

### Code Guidelines

Here are **3 rules** I have with writing (Python) code:

> 1. Try to follow PEP 8 as much as possible

Unfortunately I am the type of person who likes beautiful, formatted code.
**However, it is completely fine if you are unfamiliar with PEP 8 or styling 
guidelines**. We can work on it together after you make your pull request.

Key things to keep in mind include (feel free to do quick Google Searches):
- **Line lengths** (try to keep line **below 80 characters**; PEP 8 says 79 but 
  whichever works)
- **Naming conventions** (module, variable, class, and function names)
- **Docstring formatting**
- **Line separations** (2 blank lines around classes and functions, etc.)
- **Order of import statements** (standard → third-party → local)
- This is a strange unspoken rule I invented; this you don't have to follow. 
  All strings must use single quotes unless the text will be seen, or is meant 
  to be seen, by users (not including docstrings). For example, strings in 
  `print()` statements. The purpose of this is so that it is easy to tell in 
  future if a string is to be seen by users. Again, this is 
  **completely optional**.

===============================================

> 2. The Zen of Python

Lo, the Bible of Python:

```python
import this
```
```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

===============================================

> 3. Don't be boring

Give your code some _personality_. Avoid dull, flavorless code. You can even 
add a little joke comment if your code starts to look sleep-inducing.

## Reporting a Bug

To report a bug or issue:
1. On the repository on GitHub, go to the 
   "[Issues](https://github.com/TheGittyPerson/day-quality-tracker/issues)" tab.
2. Select "New issue"
3. This is a tiny project, and I don't really have rules on how you should 
   write an issue report. Just include a descriptive title and helpful 
information in the description.
4. Submit the issue.

## Suggesting a Feature

If you do not wish to code any features yourself, feel free to either open 
an issue as described above, mentioning and explaining the new feature you 
would like to see, or add a comment under a 
[discussion](https://github.com/TheGittyPerson/day-quality-tracker/discussions).
